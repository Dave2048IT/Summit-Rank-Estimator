# Summit Rank Estimator

A tool to estimate the medal ranks in *The Crew: Motorfest* based on the remaining time until each Summit reset. The medal ranks are determined by the time left until every Wednesday at 3:00 AM UTC, not by player progress.

## File Structure

## Features
- **Countdown Timer**: Displays the time remaining until the next Summit reset (every Wednesday at 3:00 AM UTC).
- **Estimated Medal Ranks**: Calculates the medal ranks (Platinum, Gold, Silver) based on the remaining time. The closer it gets to the Summit reset, the higher the estimated ranks.

Enjoy the Summits and stay strong! Playing with your Crew of up to 4 players can make it easier, as drafting (slipstreaming) provides a great advantage. However, this only works if your Crew is in sync and maintains good coordination. So, communicate well, stay focused, and keep the rhythm together!
