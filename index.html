	<p>Remaining time until the end of the Summit:</p>
	<h2 id="RemainingTimeText">7 days</h2>
	<p>The recommended rankings for the medals in "The Crew: Motorfest" are currently as follows:</p>
	<br>
	<table id="rankTable">
		<tr>
			<td>Platinum:</td>
			<td id="platin">---</td>

		<tr>
			<td>Gold:</td>
			<td id="gold">---</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Silver:</td>
			<td id="silber">---</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h2>The actual thresholds are:</h2>
	<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
		<td>Platinum:</td>
		<td>10,000</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>Gold:</td>
		<td>20,000</td>

	<h2>Calculate Your Final Rank</h2>
	<p>Enter your current rank to estimate your final position:</p>
	<input type="number" id="userRankInput" placeholder="Enter your rank">
	<button onclick="calculateFinalRank()">Calculate</button>
	<h3 id="rankNumber">Predicted final rank: <span id="finalRankOutput">---</span></h3>
	<br>
	
	<p> Rankings increase as the weekly Summit approaches its end, since players can choose their participation time. However, an experienced player will have an easier time both at the beginning and at the end of the Summit, as their skills allow them to always secure a good position.
	<br><br>
	Players with less experience might struggle to achieve high rankings early on, as competition is strong from the start. However, to reach the Bronze Rank, completing a test or a race and scoring at least 1 point in the Summit is enough. ;-) </p>
