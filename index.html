	<p>The recommended rankings for medals in "The Crew: Motorfest" are currently as follows:</p>
	<br>
	<table id="rankTable">
		<tr>
			<td>Platinum:</td>
			<td id="platin"></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Gold:</td>
			<td id="gold"></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Silver:</td>
			<td id="silber"></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br>
	<h2>The actual thresholds are:</h2>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Platinum:</td>
				<td>10,000</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Gold:</td>
				<td>20,000</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Silver:</td>
				<td>40,000</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<br>
	<p>Rankings increase as the weekly Summit nears its end because players can choose when to participate. However, experienced players can achieve good rankings both at the beginning and the end of the Summit due to their skills. 
	<br><br>
	Less experienced players may struggle to achieve high rankings right from the start, as competition is strong from the beginning. To reach the Bronze rank, it is enough to complete one test or race and score at least 1 point in the Summit. ;-) </p>
